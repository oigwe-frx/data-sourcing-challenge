# Data Sourcing Challenge

## Background

You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
